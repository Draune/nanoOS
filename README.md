# Why
This project was one of my assignments when I was studying abroad at Bangor University. I was very satisfied by the results I had so I wanted to save it on my github.
I think reading report.pdf will help you understand the project, it doesn't have any purpose except for "because it was fun". 
# How it works 
I used platformIO on vscode to build it.
The list of all the commands is in commands.pdf (yes the code is in hexadecimal).
If you don't have the same screen, it should be easily modified.
Feel free to use it as you want for any purpose.
